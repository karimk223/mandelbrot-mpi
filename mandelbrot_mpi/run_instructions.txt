Files created in /mnt/data/

Original sequential source you uploaded:
- sandbox:/mnt/data/Mandelbrotseq.c

To build:
1) Ensure you have MPI (Open MPI or MPICH) installed.
2) cd /mnt/data
3) make

To run (examples):
- mpirun -np 1 ./mandelbrot_static
- mpirun -np 4 ./mandelbrot_static
- mpirun -np 4 ./mandelbrot_dynamic

Outputs will appear in the working directory as:
- mandelbrot_static.pgm
- mandelbrot_dynamic.pgm

Timing:
- Each program prints a "max runtime" (the maximum local runtime across ranks), use that for speedup calculations.

If you want, I can try to compile these here (if mpicc is available) and run a quick test. Otherwise, run them on your machine or cluster.
